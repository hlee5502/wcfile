# wcfile
goal: read equations from a file and write them in a solved state to another file

qfile is the file with math questions to solve
afile is the file to write equations with answers in

example:
qfile at start of function:
     12 + 13
     24 / 5
     8 * 234
     65 - 78
     239 % 13
afile after function:
     12 +  13 = 25
     24 /   5 = 4
     8 * 234 = 1872
     65 -  78 = -13
     239 %  13 = 5
